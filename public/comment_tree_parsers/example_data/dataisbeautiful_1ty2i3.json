Still: I don&amp;#39;t think the bias observed in these awards can be completely explained away by &amp;quot;more users = more OC = more quality OC.&amp;quot; This probably has an effect, but I still suspect the main source of bias is that people forget about good submissions from earlier in the year. My main reason for this suspicion is that, like I mentioned earlier, I&amp;#39;ve noticed this effect in every &amp;quot;Best Of&amp;quot; award in basically every subreddit that has done one throughout my reddit tenure (almost 5 years).
