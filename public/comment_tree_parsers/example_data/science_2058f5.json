The conservatives predictably freaked out, but I wonder if they didn't actually have a bit of cause given what appeared to be a targeted shot.

While true, how relevant is a lengthy treatment of this to getting people excited about science? \n\nUnless you have a specific agenda of demonstrating how the church has persecuted people who offered theories on the universe and existence contrary to scripture, why include that and focus on it so much? That was an awful long time spent on a cartoon about a guy who dreamed new ideas about the universe and tried to get people to think about them, and his years of struggle and imprisonment by the church. It just kept going and going. What if instead they touched on a bit of Ptolemy, Lucretius, Copernicus, Bruno, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, etc. and showed how the ideas we now hold evolved, and then moved on to talking about the ideas? Lucretius, Copernicus, and Galileo got a few seconds each, while a quarter of the show's running time was spent on the Bruno cartoon drama - 11 minutes out of 44. It may not sound like a lot until you sit through it. (you can watch it on Fox's site for the next couple of months if you sign in with your participating cable provider's account credentials)\n\nWhy is it necessary to tell the life story of Bruno, show him getting seized in the dark by a malevolent cardinal's giant thugs, show him lying trembling in a jail cell, sleeping rough in the woods, getting laughed at for being short, getting laughed out of Cambridge, pleading his case before the ominous bad guy boss cardinal, and getting sentenced to death? Why spend so much time talking about how there was no separation of church and state, how there was no freedom of speech, and how saying the wrong thing would get you killed by by \"the most vicious form of cruel and unusual punishment\"? Why focus on the Inquisition and its purpose and methods? Is this kind of phrasing really necessary in a science show: \"It wasn't long before Bruno fell into the clutches of the thought police.\"? Why detail his time in the Inquistion's prison? Why ask, \"Why would the church go to such lengths to torment Bruno? What were they afraid of?\" Did the sentencing cardinal *really* need to have black rings around his eyes and a sinister voice? Did all the attending priests need to have black eye rings and wicked, merciless looks on their faces? Did the burning-at-the-stake scene really have to drag out like the dramatic/scary crescendo of a movie, with him disgustedly turning his face away from a proffered crucifix, with church guys piling up the fuel around his feet, with a crowd cheering as the flames rose to his Roman nose?\n\nIt was all so egregious and off track and unnecessary in a show to get people excited about science. It was super weird how long they focused on Bruno, like he was the only guy who had any of these ideas or the only guy persecuted by the church for them. (Hello? Galileo?). And it was really weird to spend so long in cartoon land. If the goal was to show that science visionaries often must defy and struggle against contemporary beliefs and societal norms, OK, but this just seemed unreasonably long and church-focused as I was watching it. It reminded me of that [creepy Mormon cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU6Uv3FptPU) that went around back during the last presidential election. Who is this stuff for?!\n\nI've read a couple of analyses of the Bruno segment, like it was an attempt to tie science to faith.

I really don't see how you can say that wasn't the intent, and that the show doesn't have a pretty overt anti-Church agenda, or at least this episode, even if one feels they deserve it, especially if one feels they deserve it.\n\nIn general, I'm happy to serve up crow to religious zealots. I'm happy to have science championed over superstition. I'm fine with an anti-church agenda to the degree necessary to get people to snap out of primitive baloney thought that retards science and progress. I'm even happy to watch lengthy cartoons about history. But why put those things in Cosmos so prominently? Why court such backlash when they could catch so many more flies with honey? Why not try instead to focus on the wonders of the universe for a wider audience of people of all stripes who want to listen? Why instantly alienate a segment of people who could benefit from it even more than most? Or if you're going to do that, if you decide you want to use Cosmos as a bludgeon to beat the stupid out of people and make them feel ashamed of their ideological and cultural allegiances in hopes that they will relent, repent, and get on board, why try to deny it or play it off?
