Based off boilerplate project [js-sketchbook-boilerplate](http://www.github.com/dlopuch/js-sketchbook-boilerplate):

To setup the sketchbook:
* `$ npm install jam`
* `$ jam install`
* `$ cd public/`
* `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
  * Starts a no-configuration HTTP server to serve directory contents and avoid complications caused by browsers
  restricting what you can do locally (eg XHR requests)
* In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8000/`
  * Navigate to the `_sketch_boilerplate_` directory and see the example sketch in action
  * Explore the files for details, then use `_sketch_boilerplate_` as a template for your sketches!
